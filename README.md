# PythonScripts

Python scripts that I use in my everyday work to analyze shotgun metagenomic sequencing data of environmental microbiomes.

Method S1 is a script to find assembled contigs with multiple antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs).

Method S2 is a script to find assembled contigs that carry antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and are binned into metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs).
